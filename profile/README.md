# Ranvire

Ranvire is a maintenance-focused fork of the Ranvier MUD engine.

The purpose of this organization is to keep Ranvier buildable and usable on modern platforms, particularly current versions of Node.js and npm, with minimal impact on existing behavior and architecture.

This work is driven by personal interest and long-term maintainability rather than roadmap commitments or community feature development.

## Using Ranvier

If you are interested in *building a MUD* using the Ranvier engine, the entry point is:

https://github.com/Ranvire/ranviermud

That repository is intended for users who already know what they want and are comfortable working independently.

## Scope and expectations

Changes made here are:
- Motivated by concrete compatibility or correctness issues
- Narrow in scope and conservative in effect
- Implemented when they align with the maintainer’s interests

Feature requests are generally not accepted unless they coincide with work the maintainer already intends to do.

## Relationship to upstream

Ranvire preserves the lineage of the Ranvier project. All credit for the original design and implementation belongs to the upstream authors and contributors.

Upstream maintainers are welcome to merge changes from this fork, and assistance will be provided if requested.

## Audience

Ranvire is primarily for:
- Developers who want a maintained Ranvier codebase
- People comfortable reading code and making their own modifications
- Users who value stability over novelty

It is not positioned as a general-purpose community hub.

This is a personal maintenance fork, kept public for practical reasons.
